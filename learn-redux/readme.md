# Learn Redux

## Running

First `npm install` to grab all the necessary dependencies. 

Then run `npm start` and open <localhost:7770> in your browser.

This starts an express development server (**devServer.js**).

There is hot reloading for components. (Change components, no need to refresh web browser)

## Production Build

Run `npm build` to create a distro folder and a bundle.js file.
